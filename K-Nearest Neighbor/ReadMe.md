# K Nearest Neighboor

K-Nearest Neighbors, or KNN for short, is one of the simplest machine learning algorithms and is used in a wide array of institutions.
KNN is a non-parametric, lazy learning algorithm. When we say a technique is non-parametric, it means that it does not make any assumptions
about the underlying data. In other words, it makes its selection based off of the proximity to other data points regardless of what feature the numerical values represent. 
Being a lazy learning algorithm implies that there is little to no training phase. 
Therefore, we can immediately classify new data points as they present themselves.

KNN.py contains a class, where KNN is implemented from skratch. Futhermore, we give a parallel version of the algorithm for class wines into three categories according to 
their features.
